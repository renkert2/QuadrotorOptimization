  abstract = {A challenge in the early-stage design of hybrid propulsion system architectures is dealing with a vast design space consisting of distinct subsystems, such as engine, motor, transmission, and battery. In this paper, two design optimization methods for a two-mode hybrid vehicle are examined: The first integrates the subsystems into a single virtual system and solves an All-In-One (AIO) problem; the second maintains system decomposition and updates individual subsystem designs through iterative exchange of information. The analysis models are detailed high-fidelity simulations of engine and electric motor components combined with two-mode transmission and overall vehicle models. Results indicate that the AIO system-optimal solution provides little additional benefit, suggesting that the industry practice to use ad-hoc decomposition-based optimization is sufficient for early-stage design in this class of problems.},

The hybridization of UAV's facilitates higher performing and more efficient aircraft but necessitates new control designs. At a vehicle level, most efforts thus far have focused on the modeling and development of novel controllers in simulation. However, validating these controllers on experimental hardware is necessary before testing these algorithms on expensive flight-ready hardware. This paper seeks to address this research gap by experimentally validating a system-level hybrid UAV model. Using the validated system model, a baseline and predictive controller are developed in simulation and experimentally validated using a series hybrid UAV powertrain testbed.},

  author = {Aksland, Christopher Thomas},
  abstract = {The emerging trend of vehicle electrification is revolutionizing the transportation industry by replacing traditional mechanical and hydraulic components with higher performing, more reliable, and more efficient electrical components. However, the introduction of a complex electrical network onboard mobile systems poses significant challenges for control design engineers. The most notable challenge is the coordination of multi-domain and multi-timescale system dynamics. This thesis seeks to address the challenge of coordination between the slow battery state of charge dynamic and faster electro-mechanical dynamics for a hybrid unmanned aerial vehicle. The graph-based modeling framework for multi-domain systems is leveraged to capture the interactions between relevant energy domains. Additionally, the modularity and scalability of this modeling approach is used to develop a dynamic model for a hybrid unmanned aerial vehicle. The system model facilities the design and development of three control architectures of varying complexity. A baseline controller is developed for sake of comparison. A battery state of charge bounding algorithm in integrated into a centralized model predictive controller to provide system coordination across timescales. Lastly, an alternative model predictive hierarchical controller is designed to provide real-time planning of the slow battery state of charge dynamics. The proposed models and controllers are experimentally validated on a novel hybrid electric UAV powertrain testbed. The controllers are evaluated on three core figures of merit: performance, reliability, and efficiency. Both simulation and experimental results show that the advanced controllers outperform the baseline in all figures of merit with a 9-12.5\% reduction in fuel usage.},

In the redesign of mechatronic systems, engineers typically seek to meet the requirements of a new application via control redesign only, but this is often insufficient and physical system (plant) design changes must be explored. Here, an integrated approach is presented for the redesign of mechatronic systems involving partial plant redesign that avoids costly complete redesign. Candidate plant modifications are identified using sensitivity analysis, and then an optimization problem is solved that minimizes redesign cost while satisfying system requirements. This formal methodology for Plant-Limited Co-Design (PLCD) is demonstrated using a robotic manipulator design problem. The PLCD result costs significantly less than the full redesign, and parametric studies illustrate the tradeoff between redesign cost and performance. It is shown that the proposed sensitivity analysis results in the lowest cost limited redesign.},

  abstract = {1 Abstract The methods of analytical target cascading (ATC) and collaborative optimization (CO) are studied with respect to their intended use and applicability. ATC was initially developed as a product development tool, while CO evolved from eorts to coordinate multidisciplinary analyses using a multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) formulation. ATC and CO are used typically to solve object-based and discipline-based decomposed system optimization problems, respectively. Their mathematical formulations appear to be similar although they were developed with dierent motivations. The article defines and compares terminologies for each approach and shows that each has unique applicability and solution process. Two new analytical example problems are employed to illustrate the distinctions between ATC and CO. The first example elucidates how each method can be used to solve the same design problem. The second example uses a new optimization formulation, nested ATC-MDO, to illustrate their complementary nature. In this formulation a system is partitioned by object, and objects are partitioned by discipline. ATC coordinates the design of system elements and an MDO method, such as CO, coordinates the multidisciplinary design of an element. The formulation maps well to organizational matrix structures. The overall study demonstrates the benefits of using complementary solution strategies in solving complex system optimization problems.},

To improve the robustness properties of systems, this paper introduces an approach that combines robust design with robust control and investigates the coupling between them. However, the computational cost of improving this robustness can often be high due to the need to solve a resulting minimax design and control optimization problem. To reduce this cost, sequential and iterative strategies are proposed and compared to an all-in-one (Aio) strategy for solving the minimax problem. These strategies are then illustrated for a case study: Robust design and robust control (RDRC) of a dc motor. Results show that the resulting strategies can improve the robustness properties of the dc motor. In addition, the coupling strength between the robust design and robust control tends to increase as the applied level of uncertainty increases.},

Based on technical specifications of batteries, motors and ESCs, component functional parameters are expressed as a function of an equivalent length. Propeller models are developed using experimental data. An optimization program is developed, which calculates the optimal design vector, employing as objective function the energy consumption or the vehicle diameter. Using this program, the influence of the payload and of the number of rotors on the design vector and the MRAV size is studied.

This article addresses the problem of the choice of the best configuration. VTOLs built since the fifties are presented and their advantages, disadvantages, and problems are discussed. Three representative eVTOLs, one for each main configuration, are compared on five main parameters and three reference missions. The parameters are disk loading, total hover time, cruise speed, practical range, and flight time. The performance of the eVTOLs on the urban, extra-urban, and long-range mission is evaluated computing the time and energy required. The results show that the best configuration depends on the mission. The multirotor is more efficient in hover. The vectored thrust jet is more efficient in cruise and has a higher range. The lift + cruise is a compromise.},

For example, the PMSM is widely used in robotics, machine tools, actuators, and it is being considered in high-power applications such as industrial drives and vehicular propulsion. It is also used for residential/commercial applications. The PMSM is known for having low torque ripple, superior dynamic performance, high efficiency and high power density. Section 1 deals with the introduction of PMSM and how it is evolved from synchronous motors. Section 2 briefly discusses about the types of PMSM. Section 3 tells about the assumptions in PMSM for modeling of PMSM and it derives the equivalent circuit of PMSM. In Section 4, permanent magnet synchronous motor drive system is briefly discussed with explanation of each blocks in the systems. Section 5 reveals about the control techniques of PMSM like scalar control, vector control and simulation of PMSM driven by field-oriented control using fuzzy logic control with space vector modulation for minimizing torque ripples. PMSM control with and without rotor position sensors along with different control techniques for controlling various parameters of PMSM for different applications is presented in Section 6.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an overview of motor drive technologies used for safety-critical aerospace applications, with a particular focus placed on the choice of candidate machines and their drive topologies. Aircraft applications demand high reliability, high availability, and high power density while aiming to reduce weight, complexity, fuel consumption, operational costs, and environmental impact. New electric driven systems can meet these requirements and also provide significant technical and economic improvements over conventional mechanical, hydraulic, or pneumatic systems. Fault-tolerant motor drives can be achieved by partitioning and redundancy through the use of multichannel three-phase systems or multiple single-phase modules. Analytical methods are adopted to compare caged induction, reluctance, and PM motor technologies and their relative merits. The analysis suggests that the dual (or triple) three-phase PMAC motor drive may be a favored choice for general aerospace applications, striking a balance between necessary redundancy and undue complexity, while maintaining a balanced operation following a failure. The modular single-phase approach offers a good compromise between size and complexity but suffers from high total harmonic distortion of the supply and high torque ripple when faulted. For each specific aircraft application, a parametrical optimization of the suitable motor configuration is needed through a coupled electromagnetic and thermal analysis, and should be verified by finite-element analysis.},

Matching the experimental data of the first fully electrified version of the X-57 Maxwell experimental vehicle requires high fidelity thermal analysis to sufficiently capture the electric motor and inverter temperature profiles. Qualification test data of the motors and inverters is used to validate finite element analysis models, which are then used to predict thermal performance over various notional mission transients. An additional thermal-hydraulic models is used to estimate flow characteristics through the propulsor nacelle and component heat sinks. After calibration of the higher order models , overall component sizing and peak temperature constraints can be distilled to reduced order models, to improve model flexibility and utility. The methods and experiments described are a snapshot of ongoing work and include challenges encountered during motor performance verification.}

  abstract = {Planetary gear sets (PGs) play a key role in the design of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) because they allow the realization of many unique powertrain designs using a limited number of components. By leveraging the capability of this mechanical device, an automated design process for PG-based HEV systems focusing on both fuel economy and performance is introduced in this paper. The design process consists of five major stages. In the first stage, all possible powertrain modes of an HEV design are automatically generated with a given set of powertrain components. In the second stage, all powertrain types that can be formed with a given set of components are mathematically identified, and each feasible mode is classified under one of these powertrain types. In the third stage, computationally efficient linear programming solvers suitable for vector operations are developed for each powertrain type to assess the gradeability, launch torque, overtaking torque, and acceleration time of each mode for all PG gear ratio combinations. In the fourth stage, the combination of modes that meets the performance requirements, and the number and location of clutches that make these mode transitions possible, are explored. As a result, each potent mode combination, the clutches necessary for the mode transition, and the auxiliary modes established as a result of all clutch state combinations constitute a design that meets the performance criteria. In the last stage, the fuel economy improvement potential of each competent design is evaluated. The results show that light-duty truck performance requirements can be met by many two-PG HEV designs without sacrificing fuel economy if the appropriate analysis and synthesis techniques for exploring the entire design space are developed.},

Currently, most multicopter propulsion systems are designed by experience and trial-and-error experiments, which are costly and ineffective. This paper proposes a simple and practical method to help designers find the optimal propulsion system according to the given design requirements. First, the modeling methods for four basic components of the propulsion system including propellers, motors, electric speed controls, and batteries are studied, respectively. Second, the whole optimization design problem is simplified and decoupled into several subproblems. By solving these subproblems, the optimal parameters of each component can be obtained, respectively. Finally, based on the obtained optimal component parameters, the optimal product of each component can be quickly located and determined from the corresponding database. Experiments and statistical analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed method is so fast and practical that it has been successfully applied to a web server to provide online optimization design service for users.},

The offline algorithm finds the optimal components (propeller and electronic speed controller) for each motor to establish its component combination, and subsequently, these component combinations and their key performance parameters are stored in a combination database. The online algorithm obtains the multicopter design results that satisfy the given requirements by searching through the component combinations in the database and calculating the optimal parameters for the battery and airframe. Subsequently, these requirement-satisfied multicopter design results are obtained and sorted according to an objective function that contains evaluation indexes including size, weight, performance, and practicability. The proposed method has the advantages of high precision and quick calculating speed because parameter calibrations and time-consuming calculations are completed offline. Experiments are performed to validate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method. Comparisons with the brutal search method and other design methods demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.},

The chapter provides the equivalent circuits for each of these machines along with an analysis and discussion of their steady-state operating characteristics. It presents the widely used converters, and the analysis and performance of several common dc drive systems. The chapter analyzes the operation and establishes the average-value model for one, two and four quadrant chopper drive systems.

  abstract = {This paper presents a high-order graph-based model for an electric vehicle (EV) and decomposes the model into a hierarchy suitable for use in hierarchical control. The increased electrification of vehicular systems generates electrothermal performance challenges, and hierarchical control is a strong candidate to mitigate these issues. In order to implement hierarchical control, a multi-level hierarchy of electro-thermal models is necessary. Numerous studies provide electro-thermal models, but this literature is decoupled from the results on hierarchy development through graph clustering techniques. This paper couples these bodies of literature by providing three contributions. First, previous graph-based modeling techniques are extended to include high-order models of electrical components. Second, these techniques are applied to an EV system to produce an EV graph-based model. Third, a graph clustering algorithm is applied to the vehicle model to generate a hierarchy of models. By defining an energy-based clustering metric, the vertices within each level of the hierarchy are partitioned to avoid breaking important power flow connections. This yields a hierarchy of models that can facilitate hierarchical control algorithm development and improve performance of electrified systems.},

In addition, we allow incorporating a variety of other metrics (such as payload, battery usage, size, and cost) into the design process and exploring tradeoffs between them. We show the efficacy of our method and system by designing, optimizing, fabricating, and operating multicopters with complex geometries and propeller configurations.

The effectiveness of the proposed analytical model is verified in comparison with measurement of a handmade prototype. Based on this analytical model the air gap flux density, torque and induced voltage of the prototype motor are predicted. For an effective selection of motor parameters, a multipurpose optimization algorithm is developed, which is based on the distributed multilevel ant-stigmergy algorithm.

IC engines \textendash{} as classified earlier \textendash{} belong to the big family of internal combustion. However, it is of the intermittent combustion subgroup. This subgroup of aero piston engines is either of the rotary or reciprocating families. Rotary engines are next categorized as either conventional or Wankel engines. Reciprocating engines have different types, namely, inline, horizontally opposed, V-type, X-type, H-type, and radial type engines. For pressure or power boosting, either superchargers or turbochargers are added to reciprocating engines. A detailed aerodynamics and thermodynamics of reciprocating engines is given. Terminology for four-stroke engine and air standard analysis is presented. To examine the generated power and efficiency of reciprocating engines, both Otto and Diesel cycles for four strokes and two strokes types are thoroughly analyzed. The developments in power and efficiency when supercharging or turbocharging are examined.Since IC engines cannot propel an aircraft by itself, engine is coupled to a propeller to generate such a force. Wright flyer I was the first plane to be propelled by a propeller. Nowadays, 80 \% nearly of the flying vehicles are powered by IC engines. These are small aircrafts/helicopters or home-made planes. At first, propellers are classified based on its source of power, material, coupling to the output shaft, control, number of propellers coupled to each engine, direction of rotation, propulsion method, and number of blades. Detailed aerodynamic theories for propeller design, axial momentum (or actuator disk), modified momentum, and blade element are discussed. Non-dimensional parameters defining propeller performance, namely, thrust and power coefficients as well as advance ratio, are derived. Detail analysis of the generated thrust from each blade segment and the total thrust are described through worked examples. Charts for thrust, power, and propulsive efficiency of two- and three-bladed propellers are given.},

All the three types are composed of three stationary modules, namely, intake (or inlet), combustion chamber, and nozzle. Moreover, this category of engines cannot provide a static thrust and so never used alone in takeoff phase. A brief historical review for each engine is first given. Next both aerodynamic and thermodynamic analyses are given. The endeavor of these analyses is to calculate the generated thrust, fuel consumed, TSFC, specific impulse as well as the three efficiencies: propulsive, thermal, and overall.Pulsejet engines are divided into three groups, namely valved, valveless, and pulse detonation engines. The first two types are governed by Humphrey cycle. Noise and excessive fuel consumption are the main reasons for ceasing its usage except for some military applications. However, recent interest in pulse detonation types arose, though still in the research and testing phases.Ramjet engines are used both in aircrafts and missiles. It may be classified either as subsonic or supersonic types, nuclear or non-nuclear types, as well as solid and liquid fueled types. Combustion in all types is limited to subsonic speeds. Recently, a double throat type is invented for which detailed description and analysis is also given.When flight speed is at the higher range of supersonic domain and merges with hypersonic one, scramjet engine is a necessity. Scramjet stands for a Supersonic Combustion Ramjet. It is still in the research phase with prototype testing. An isolator is added to the basic three modules of Ram-Based Engines in dual mode scramjet. Analysis of classical scramjet as well as that fitted with isolator is given. Numerous examples that clarify performance of each engine are thoroughly treated.},

Next, thermodynamic analysis of the operating cycle is given.Turboprop engines power many bush, commuter, and heavy transport aircrafts flying at moderate subsonic speeds. Both single and double spool are examined. The engine is composed of two main parts, namely, gas turbine and propeller. Gearbox couples the propeller to the driving turbine. The exhaust gases leave the engine at very low speeds, and thus its share in power generated is around 15 \%. The propeller develops the great share of power.Turboshaft engines are employed in most helicopters, maritime applications, as well as some race cars. In both applications planetary gearbox is mostly used. Exhaust gases leave turboshaft engines at nearly zero speeds.Propfan engines use a gas generator to drive an unshielded propeller like a turboprop, with a large number of short, highly twisted blades, similar to the fan of a turbofan engine. Propfan engines have the highest propulsive efficiency among all air-breathing engines including shaft-based, ram-based, and turbine-based engines.},

These combined optimality conditions differ from the individual sets of necessary conditions for plant and controller optimality by a coupling term that reflects the plant design's influence on the plant dynamics and control input constraints.},

Suspension dynamics are modeled using a two degree-of-freedom, linear and time-invariant quarter-car model whose ability to capture the influence of the passive stiffness on rattle space depends on the ground disturbance's spectral density. Nested optimization, a strategy that guarantees system optimality, is presented and used to find the optimal suspension system design. The design exhibits superior performance compared to its passive, active and sequentially optimized passive/active counterparts because it accounts for the coupling between the passive and active suspension optimization problems.},

A good VTOL design will offset this disadvantage by transitioning to conventional forward flight, thus travelling at much higher efficiency than a comparable rotorcraft, for an overall improvement in mission performance.},

In particular, one of several pulse-width modulation (PWM) control strategies that allows the amplitude of the fundamental component of the voltage to be readily controlled is discussed. Six-step modulation, extended sine-triangle modulation, and space-vector modulation are all voltage-source modulation schemes. The chapter explains usage of these schemes to develop an open-loop voltage-regulated converter. Hysteresis modulation and delta modulation are both current source-based schemes. These are used as the basis of developing an open-loop current-regulated converter. Finally, the chapter focuses on closed-loop methods of regulating q- and d-axis voltages and currents.},

  abstract = {Over the last few decades, control engineers have focused on developing innovative control theories and algorithms to regulate systems. These control efforts are usually at the last stage of a sequential strategy that allows engineering departments to work independently and consecutively toward the design of new products and systems. Control algorithms are usually developed at the end of that sequential process, once the mechanical, electrical, and other subsystems are completely defined. This paper discusses a different approach, named Control Co-Design (CCD). Following a concurrent engineering strategy that considers multidisciplinary subsystem interactions from the beginning of the design process, CCD applies control concepts to design the entire system and reach optimal solutions that are not achievable otherwise. This approach is a game changer for the control engineer, who will be not only the designer of advanced control algorithms but also the natural leader of the design of new products and systems. This paper describes some historic engineering breakthroughs achieved by applying CCD and explores some relevant application areas. It also presents three complementary CCD methodologies that include control-inspired paradigms, formal mathematical co-optimization techniques, and co-simulation campaigns to enhance engineering creativity and achieve radically new optimal designs.},

The methodology is applied to three different types of propellers to showcase its versatility, and experiments show that the procedure can accurately predict the rotor forces.

  abstract = {The advent of high-speed computers and sophisticated software tools has made the computation of derivatives for functions defined by evaluation programs both easier and more important. On one hand, the dependence of certain program outputs on certain input parameters can now be determined and quantified more or less automatically, i.e., without the user having to append or rewrite the function evaluation procedure. On the other hand, such qualitative and quantitative dependence analysis is invaluable for the optimization of key output objectives with respect to suitable decision variables or the identification of model parameters with respect to given data. In fact, we may juxtapose the mere simulation of a physical or social system by the repeated running of an appropriate computer model for various input data with its optimization by a systematic adjustment of certain decision variables and model parameters. The transition from the former computational paradigm to the latter may be viewed as a central characteristic of present-day scientific computing. Optimization nowadays already forms an important application area for exact derivative calculation using algorithmic differentiation. This includes the provision of gradients and Hessians for the unconstrained case, as, for example, in nonlinear finite element calculations [Wri08], the optimal laser control of chemical reactions [BCL01] or the optimization of low-pass analog filters [Alk98]. In the constrained case, algorithmic differentiation can be used to compute the required Jacobians, Hessians, or Hessian-vector products. Here, the applications areas include chemical engineering [AB04], race car performance [CS+01], and industrial production processes [KW00]. Since 1997 the Network Enabled Optimization Server (NEOS) at Argonne National Laboratory has been using algorithmic differentiation to compute gradients and Jacobians of remotely supplied user code for optimization objectives and constraints [CMM97]. The modelling language AMPL and GAMS have incorporated both modes of algorithmic differentiation to provide first and second derivatives for various optimization solvers. Also multicriteria optimization benefits from exact derivatives, e.g., to optimize medical radiotherapy [JMF06]. For the field of parameter estimation, algorithmic differentiation is used to improve, for example, weather models [GK+06] or the simulation of the climate [KHL06]. The cover shows the independence between various vector quantities in optimal design as discussed in Chapter 15 superimposed on a global sensitivity map. It was provided to us by Patrick Heimbach of MIT and represents the derivative of the poleward heat transfer with respect to local maritime temperatures.},

  abstract = {An emerging potential market within the aviation industry is short, frequent air taxi flights within the urban airspace. These air taxis (also called urban air mobility or UAM vehicles) are envisioned to be vertical take-off and landing designs which are capable of carrying 1 to 15 passengers in an intra-urban environment with less than 50 nautical miles of range. Numerous vehicle conceptual designs have been proposed by various industry and government organizations to fulfill these potential missions. These concepts are enabled by recent advancements in a number of areas including propulsion and power systems. While new technologies are making these vehicles possible, this new UAM design space is large, unexplored, and multidisciplinary in nature. New challenges exist in identifying and creating optimized designs for these unique vehicles with new propulsion technologies. This work presents the development of a suite of propulsion system analysis tools, which when coupled together, can improve the multidisciplinary conceptual design and optimization of UAM vehicle propulsion systems. These analysis tools are then applied to the design optimization of a turboelectric propulsion system for a notional UAM tiltwing concept. The optimization demonstration for this vehicle shows how a tightly-coupled multidisciplinary design can be developed which considers both physical design characteristics and operating schedules. Furthermore, the results explore trade-offs in the thermal management system design and how those trade-offs impact the overall vehicle.},

  abstract = {Target cascading is a key challenge in the early product development stages of large complex artifacts: how to propagate the desirable top level design specifications (or targets) to appropriate specifications for the various subsystems and components in a consistent and efficient manner. Consistency means that all parts of the designed system should work well together, while efficiency means that the process itself should avoid iterations at later stages, which are costly in time and resources. In the present article target cascading is formalized by a process modeled as a multilevel optimal design problem. Design targets are cascaded down to lower levels using partitioning of the original problem into a hierarchical set of subproblems. For each design problem at a given level, an optimization problem is formulated to minimize deviations from the propagated targets and thus achieve intersystem compatibility. A coordination strategy links all subproblem decisions so that the overall system performance targets are met. The process is illustrated with an explicit analytical problem and a simple automotive chassis design model that demonstrates how the process can be applied in practice.},

High-power electrical systems on board modern and future aircraft perform a variety of mission- and flight-critical tasks, while thermal management systems actively cool these electronics to satisfy component-specific temperature constraints, ensuring safe and reliable operation. In this paper, coordination of these electrical and thermal systems is performed using a hierarchical control approach that decomposes the multi-energy domain, constrained optimization problem into smaller, more computationally efficient problems that can be solved in real-time. A hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experimental testbed is used to evaluate the proposed hierarchical MPC in comparison to a baseline controller for a scaled, laboratory representation of an aircraft electro-thermal system. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the baseline controller across a range of electrical loading in terms of both efficient energy management and constraint satisfaction.},

Each subsystem has a corresponding model predictive controller that can be part of a decentralized, distributed, or larger hierarchical control structure. By exploiting the structure of the coupling between subsystems, stability of the closed-loop system is guaranteed by augmenting each model predictive controller with a local passivity constraint.},

  abstract = {Hybrid energy storage systems are a popular alternative to traditional electrical energy storage mechanisms for electric vehicles. Consisting of multiple heterogeneous storage elements, these systems require thoughtful design and control techniques to ensure adequate electrical performance and minimal added weight. In this work, a graph-based design optimization framework is extended to facilitate design and control optimization of a battery-ultracapacitor hybrid energy storage system. For a given high ramp rate load profile, a hybrid electrical energy storage system consisting of battery and ultracapacitor packs with proportional-integral controllers is considered. A multi-objective optimization problem is formulated to simultaneously optimize sizing and performance of the system by minimizing mass and deviations from ideal controller performance. This optimization is achieved by adjusting the size of the energy storage system and parameters of the feedback controller. A Pareto curve is provided, which exhibits the tradeoffs between sizing and performance of the hybrid energy storage system. Dynamic simulation results demonstrate optimized designs outperform initial designs in both sizing and electrical performance objectives. The design and control optimization approach is shown to outperform a similar sizing optimization approach.},

In the context of global sustainability, they must fulfill various requirements, not only physically and technologically but also environmentally.

This paper aims to present a review of the design optimization methods for electrical machines, including design analysis methods and models, optimization models, algorithms and methods/strategies. Several efficient optimization methods/strategies are highlighted with comments, including surrogate-model based and multi-level optimization methods. In addition, two promising and challenging topics in both academic and industrial communities are discussed, and two novel optimization methods are introduced for advanced design optimization of electrical machines. First, a system-level design optimization method is introduced for the development of advanced electric drive systems. Second, a robust design optimization method based on the design for six-sigma technique is introduced for high-quality manufacturing of electrical machines in production. Meanwhile, a proposal is presented for the development of a robust design optimization service based on industrial big data and cloud computing services. Finally, five future directions are proposed, including smart design optimization method for future intelligent design and production of electrical machines.},

The split configuration is an efficient and more flexible transmission configuration and is the focus of this study. A three-step design methodology is developed to systematically and exhaustively explore all possible split configurations using two planetary gears: Step 1 checks mechanical feasibility of configurations; Step 2 develops optimal power management inspired by Pontryagin's Minimum Principle; and Step 3 finds optimal component sizes.

  abstract = {Designing and selecting hardware for a multirotor can be challenging in order to get the best flight performance out of the system. In addition to selecting the hardware, the number of actuators can also be altered. For a 4 actuator (quadrotor) setup, one set of hardware can give the optimal design, while for a 6 actuator setup (hexarotor) the same hardware may not necessarily give the same response. In this paper we present a design optimization process of a multirotor, where the hardware is selected from a set of low-cost off-the-shelf standard RC hobby parts. Constraining the problem to a given hardware ensures existence of the selected hardware, and the design can be implemented. Also the system equations will remain linear when selecting from a set of given data. Hence the problem is defined as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) and solved with the Cplex solver. The Cplex solver is fast and the solution is close to the optimal solution of the problem. In this paper the multirotor is designed for 4, 6 and 8 actuators, and the design with the lowest value of the objective function is the optimal design. As shown, optimizing the design for a given set of hardware and payload results in a 11 minutes longer time of flight, than just using the biggest propeller, motor and battery available.},

Mechatronic systems, being a mix of mechanical and electronic systems, deal with multi-domain systems. Such systems may typically include translational, rotational, thermofluid, electrical, electromechanical and electronic systems. Modeling and simulation of such multi-domain systems pose formidable new challenges and, hence, demand new strategies and techniques for reliable solutions. The bond graph method (BGM) is rapidly emerging to offer a new modeling and simulation methodology that is ideally suited to effectively unify knowledge pertaining to multi-domain systems for mechatronic applications. The BGM combined with genetic programming (GP) offers tremendous opportunities in artificial intelligence, image processing, and robotic and industrial automation, The extension of BGM for applications to fields such as social behavior, economics and operational research is a very active topic of current research. This work illustrates the methodology offered by BGM for modeling and simulation of mechatronic systems.},

Moreover, a single energy storage technology might not provide the most benefit out of powertrain electrification. In this paper, a generalized framework for the simultaneous selection of the optimal energy storage device, in the form of a standalone or hybrid solution, and online energy management is presented. This paper investigates the cooperation of energy-dense Li-ion batteries and power-dense supercapacitors to assist engine operation in a series hybrid electric military truck. Pontryagin's minimum principle is adopted as the energy management strategy in a forward-looking vehicle simulator, in which the optimal design and control parameters are found using particle swarm optimization. Simulation results show that adopting a hybrid energy storage system reduces fuel consumption by 13\% compared to the case of battery-only hybridized powertrain.},

In Ch. 3 we describe a method that allows teams of quadrotors to work together to carry payloads that they could not carry individually. In Ch. 4 we discuss an online parameter estimation method for quadrotors transporting payloads which enables a quadrotor to use its dynamics in order to learn about the payload it is carrying and also adapt its control law in order to improve tracking performance. In Ch. 5 we present a trajectory generation method that enables quadrotors to fly through narrow gaps at various orientations and perch on inclined surfaces. Chapter 6 discusses a method for generating dynamically optimal trajectories through a series of predefined waypoints and safe corridors and Ch. 7 extends that method to enable heterogeneous quadrotor teams to quickly rearrange formations and avoid a small number of obstacles.},

  abstract = {Urban air mobility (UAM) is an emerging aviation market that seeks to revolutionize mobility around metropolitan areas via a safe, efficient, and accessible on-demand air transportation system for passengers and cargo. In this paper we describe our three-pronged approach to studying passenger-carrying UAM missions, and we detail the first phase of this approach, which consists of defining an initial set of requirements for multiple exemplar UAM missions. The development of these mission requirements provides justifiable assumptions that feed the second phase of the approach, which is performing aircraft conceptual design studies. Vehicle design is not included in this paper, but the work described here will define sizing missions for follow-on design and sizing studies. The aircraft that emerge from the design studies can then feed the third phase of our UAM analysis approach, which involves simulating an entire UAM network over a metropolitan area to study transportation-system level characteristics. Iteration between each of the three phases of the UAM analysis approach will be necessary to propagate lessons learned as our research progresses and as the UAM community coalesces on a more unified vision for UAM. Therefore, we anticipate that the mission requirements set forth in this paper will be modified over time as the urban air mobility concept matures.},

  abstract = {Energy performance, e.g. flight time and range, is currently a major challenge limiting the electric multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Improving UAV energy performance through design, control, and planning has received increasing attention lately. The basis for these efforts is an in-depth understanding of the underlying governing dynamics, which involves the aerodynamics of the rotor-propeller assembly, electro-mechanical dynamics of the motor and motor controller, electrical dynamics of the battery, and the rigid body dynamics of UAV. A system-level model incorporating all these dynamics, and more importantly, their coupling is missing in current literature. The goal of this paper is to fill this critical gap in the state of art. We first develop sub-models for each sub-system dynamics based on first principles, and then integrate them based on input-output coupling to formulate a system-level model. The model is capable of predicting the response of critical system variables and their mutual impact during the UAV flight operation. One key observation is that battery voltage can drop by 16\% due to the energy consumed by propulsion, which in turn causes 14\% decrease in rotor speed and 24\% decline in torque and thrust (under the same actuation command) over the course of flight.},

  abstract = {Birds routinely execute post-stall maneuvers with a speed and precision far beyond the capabilities of our best aircraft control systems. One remarkable example is a bird exploiting post-stall pressure drag in order to rapidly decelerate to land on a perch. Stall is typically associated with a loss of control authority, and it is tempting to attribute this agility of birds to the intricate morphology of the wings and tail, to their precision sensing apparatus, or their ability to perform thrust vectoring. Here we ask whether an extremely simple fixed-wing glider (no propeller) with only a single actuator in the tail is capable of landing precisely on a perch from a large range of initial conditions. To answer this question, we focus on the design of the flight control system; building upon previous work which used linear feedback control design based on quadratic regulators (LQR), we develop nonlinear feedback control based on nonlinear model-predictive control (NMPC) and ``LQR-Trees''. Through simulation using a flat-plate model of the glider, we find that both nonlinear methods are capable of achieving an accurate bird-like perching maneuver from a large range of initial conditions; the ``LQR-Trees'' algorithm is particularly useful due to its low computational burden at runtime and its inherent performance guarantees. With this in mind, we then implement the ``LQR-Trees'' algorithm on real hardware and demonstrate a 95 percent perching success rate over 147 flights for a wide range of initial speeds. These results suggest that, at least in the absence of significant disturbances like wind gusts, complex wing morphology and sensing are not strictly required to achieve accurate and robust perching even in the post-stall flow regime.},

The focus of this paper is on the experimental measurements on Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion) cells for the parameter identification of Equivalent Electrical Circuit Models (ECM). Depending on model accuracy, a trade-off has to be made between a simple and a complex model of the cell. A simple model is not suitable for accurately simulate the cell dynamics while a complex model is computationally expensive. Different types of equivalent circuit models are proposed in literature; first- and second-order resistor-capacitor (RC) models for Li-Ion cells are studied comparatively in this paper. Equivalent circuit parameters are identified, experimentally, and models of the cells are implemented in Matlab/Simulink. The outputs of the models are compared with actual data to calculate the error. In the models, the parameters dependency on the temperature and the age of the cell are neglected. The simulation results show that in constant current pulse discharge, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) expressed as a percentage for the first-order RC model is 2.78\% and for the second-order RC model is 1.96\%. These results are obtained without any optimization of the parameters.},

Instead of using the swash plate mechanism employed in most rotary-wing flight vehicle, the UAV was controlled by four fixed-pitch rotors/propellers. The objective of this design optimization problem is to select the most suitable set of components from a range of commercial-off-the-shelf products, and organize the vehicle components/payloads, such that the resulting flight vehicle has the most compact overall size without violating any given physical or mission constraint. Genetic algorithms are employed as the optimization engine because of their proven results.},

We address these issues with a rotor design technique for maximising thrust and the application of a novel rotor mast configuration. An aero-elastic blade design is described and its performance results are presented. A sprung teetering rotor hub that allows adjustment of the blade flapping characteristics and a quad-rotor dynamic model with blade flapping are introduced. The use of inverted rotors is shown to produce favorable stability properties for the Mark II X-4 Flyer. 1},

Using this approach, many of the basic concepts and interpretations of this general transformation are readily and concisely established.

  abstract = {Choosing the propulsion and associated power system for a drone typically requires a manual trial-and-error approach iterating through component combinations. The multiobjective nature of the design goals, including payload and flight time, along with the incompatibility of some component options make the design process time consuming. Moreover, manual designers may be unsure if their selected design is optimal. This thesis presents a design method that optimizes the primary flight system components of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). A genetic algorithm (GA) and blade element momentum theory (BEMT) are used with cost functions defined by: flight time, payload capacity, and cost. The aim of this paper is to present this design methodology and to compare the multirotor aircraft genetic design algorithm (MAGDA) with alternate design methods, including: the manual design method and electric multirotor sizing tool (EMST). We show that MAGDA chooses components that yield a 10\% and 17\% longer flight time than the manual and EMST design methods, respectively.},

  abstract = {Multicopters are attracting more and more attention these years. In the design stage, designers and users wonder if an assembled multicopter can meet their performance requirements, such as hovering endurance, system efficiency, maximum load, maximum pitch, and maximum flight distance. However, in practice, they used to evaluate the performance of a multicopter through lots of flight experiments or by experience, which are normally inefficient and costly. This motivates us to propose a comprehensive offline evaluation algorithm of multicopter performance. The performance indices considered are mainly determined by the propulsion system, including motors, propellers, electronic speed controllers, and batteries. Therefore, in the first stage of this research, models are established for the components of a propulsion system. In order to facilitate the application, only technical specifications of components offered by manufacturers are required as the input of the models. Based on the models and their relationships, equations describing performance indices are established and then solved to perform the evaluation. Finally, several examples are given to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed evaluation method. As a result, a website ( www.flyeval.com) is established, which can provide users with the performance evaluation mentioned in this paper.},

These models were developed using open data sources, assuming current and advanced technology levels, and range from 650 to 7,500 shaft output horsepower (485 to 5,600 kW). Documenting the methodology, assumptions, and resulting performance realizes important benefits for NASA and the aviation community. NASA concept vehicle efforts using these propulsion models can more readily shared among the government, industry and university community as common baselines to support current and future work. Assessing the benefits of advanced technologies and new configurations can be facilitated using these models, which helps guide technology investment. As the various modeling conceptual vehicle and mission analysis environments advance, these models can be used directly for broader systems analysis studies, including optimization within the propulsion model itself. To perform this effort, the turboshaft engine is briefly discussed, highlighting the specific components and their expected performance characteristics over the power range and technology levels considered. Engine configurations will also be discussed as they will vary based on power output and assumed technology level. Engine performance, such as airflow, power output and weight will be reported, noting trends that are important for system studies. The effect of advanced propulsion technologies on RVLT concept vehicles are also reported. Finally, potential future propulsion modeling work will be proposed.},

The chapter talks about the method of incorporating these effects of saturation into a computer representation. Expressions for the energy stored in the coupling fields and for electromagnetic and electrostatic forces are also derived. The chapter then briefly considers a graphical interpretation of the energy conversion process, and concludes with a discussion on the steady-state and dynamic performance of the elementary electromagnetic system.},

  abstract = {A novel design method for mechatronic systems, based on knowledge-based engineering techniques, is proposed in this research study. The method is particularly suited for mechatronic vehicles which are inherently unstable and require control systems for stabilization. The method is implemented in a dedicated software tool in which physical entities of the product are defined as classes with attributes. Nonphysical elements of the system and procedures for the design and analysis of the system are defined as functions with variables. The method has two key features. First, multiphysics simulation models and associated analysis functions are generated automatically within a multidisciplinary analysis and optimization framework. These models are not restricted to geometrical aspects for mechanical design, but also include the system architecture, dynamics, aerodynamics, electronic control systems and associated software codes. Second, for each representation of a design, a dedicated control system is developed completely automatically, based on the multiphysics simulation model, using model inversion control. These two features make it possible to analyze the dynamics and performance of inherently unstable mechatronic vehicles already in the early design phases when the vehicle is still subject to large configuration design changes. The method is demonstrated for the design of a multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle. Thirty thousand possible design solutions are evaluated by the system without manual interference. For each design, a dedicated control system is created and five flight test maneuvers are simulated in order to assess the aircraft performance and flying qualities. A global optimization process is applied for two conflicting requirements and the process is convergent at two optimum solutions.},

In this paper, we present an altitude control algorithm for quadcopters that consists of a combination of nonlinear and linear controllers. The smooth transition between the nonlinear and linear modes are guaranteed through controller gains that are obtained based on mathematical analysis. The proposed controller takes advantage and addresses some known shortcomings of the conventional proportional\textendash integral\textendash derivative control method. The algorithm is simple to implement, and we prove its stability through the Lyapunov theory. By prescribing certain flight conditions, we use numerical simulations to compare the control performance of our control method to that of a conventional proportional\textendash derivative\textendash integral approach. Furthermore, we use a DJI-F450 drone equipped with a laser ranging sensor as the experimental quadcopter platform to evaluate the performance of our new controller in real flight conditions. Numerical simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract = {Planetary gears (PGs) have been used in power-split hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles, sometimes with clutches to enable multimode operations. Chevrolet Volt is a well-known production vehicle using such technologies; it achieves excellent performance in both charge-depleting (CD) and charge-sustaining modes. In this paper, a detailed analysis of the General Motors (GM) Voltec powertrain used in the 2016 Chevrolet Volt (Volt Gen 2) is presented. We search through a large topological space, which includes a total of around 1 million design candidates to find different powertrain layouts that achieve the same or better acceleration and fuel economy in comparison with the benchmark: a simulated Volt Gen 2. The key technologies enabling such large-scale design exercise are discussed, and preliminary findings are reported. The case study results show that 49 designs achieve better charge-sustaining, CD, and launching performances than the benchmark, which clearly demonstrated the value of the proposed design methodology.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a biomechatronic approach to the design of an anthropomorphic artificial hand able to mimic the natural motion of the human fingers. The hand is conceived to be applied to prosthetics as well as to humanoid and personal robotics; hence, anthropomorphism is a fundamental requirement to be addressed both in the physical aspect and in the functional behavior. In this paper, a biomechatronic approach is addressed to harmonize the mechanical design of the anthropomorphic artificial hand with the design of the hand control system. More in detail, this paper focuses on the control system of the hand and on the optimization of the hand design in order to obtain a human-like kinematics and dynamics. By evaluating the simulated hand performance, the mechanical design is iteratively refined. The mechanical structure and the ratio between number of actuators and number of degrees of freedom (DOFs) have been optimized in order to cope with the strict size and weight constraints that are typical of application of artificial hands to prosthetics and humanoid robotics. The proposed hand has a kinematic structure similar to the natural hand featuring three articulated fingers (thumb, index, and middle finger with 3 DOF for each finger and 1 DOF for the abduction/adduction of the thumb) driven by four dc motors. A special underactuated transmission has been designed that allows keeping the number of motors as low as possible while achieving a self-adaptive grasp, as a result of the passive compliance of the distal DOF of the fingers. A proper hand control scheme has been designed and implemented for the study and optimization of hand motor performance in order to achieve a human-like motor behavior. To this aim, available data on motion of the human fingers are collected from the neuroscience literature in order to derive a reference input for the control. Simulation trials and computer-aided design (CAD) mechanical tools are used to obtain a finger model including its dynamics. Also the closed-loop control system is simulated in order to study the effect of iterative mechanical redesign and to define the final set of mechanical parameters for the hand optimization. Results of the experimental tests carried out for validating the model of the robotic finger, and details on the process of integrated refinement and optimization of the mechanical structure and of the hand motor control scheme are extensively reported in the paper.},
